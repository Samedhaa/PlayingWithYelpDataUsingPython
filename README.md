# OverView : 

This repository contains IPython (Jupyter) Notebook that contains Data from Yelp, which i used some of the python libraries to navigate the data, such as pandas, numpy and math.

⋅⋅* i started by importing the data from 'csv' File.
⋅⋅* then i printed the data so i can visualize it.
⋅⋅* then i started to looking for many properties in the data such as :
                      •'average number of reviews per reviewer'
                      •'average number of cool votes per reviewer'
                      •'average number of funny votes per reviewer'
                      •'average number of useful votes per reviewer'
⋅⋅* and then i was looking for the log of the properties with taking care if the data has value = Zero.
⋅⋅* then i toke the percentage of these properties and print it !
