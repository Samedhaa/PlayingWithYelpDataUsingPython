# Overview : 

#### This repository contains IPython (Jupyter) Notebook that contains Data from Yelp, which i used some of the python libraries to navigate the data, such as pandas, numpy and math.

##### 1. i started by importing the data from 'csv' File.

2. then i printed the data so i can visualize it.

3. then i started to looking for many properties in the data such as :  
        • average number of reviews per reviewer.  
        • average number of cool votes per reviewer.   
        • average number of funny votes per reviewer.   
        • average number of useful votes per reviewer.  
4. and then i was looking for the log of the properties with taking care if the data has value = Zero.

5. then i toke the percentage of these properties and print it !
